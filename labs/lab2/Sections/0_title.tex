%This template should be used for reporting case E. The template is inspired from and adapted to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), & United States of America. (2004). Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement. Url: https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/199408.pdf  

%For the sake of the laboratory assignments you can use the guide provided by NIST in order to get a better understanding of the forensic process and most importantly on how to document and report your investigation. 

%A small note regarding the investigation hours. Since each lab is good for 1 ECTS credit it gives each student about 26.6 hours of work. Please note that in teams of three the man hours is multiplied by three.

%<Describe how the evidence was examined>

Sample text:
The directory and file structures, including file dates and times, were recorded. A file header search was conducted to locate all graphic images. The image files were reviewed and those files containing images of what appeared to be children depicted in a sexually explicit manner were preserved. Shortcut files were recovered that pointed to files on floppy disks with sexually explicit file names involving children. The last accessed time and date of the files indicated the files were last accessed 10 days before the laptop was delivered to Mom \& Pop's.
